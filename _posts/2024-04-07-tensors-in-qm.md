# This blog post explores why tensors are so prevalent in quantum mechanics

Before we can begin and talk about **tensors** in Quantum Mechanics we need to start with a refresher on how we can represent the state of a particle.  

We know from Quantum Mechanics that an electron or any other particle can be represented as a state vector $ \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} $. We also know that this state vector can be written as a linear combination (or superposition) of all possible configurations where the coefficients are the the probabilities of that particular configuration occurring

$$ \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} = P(\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_1}})\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_1}} + P(\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_2}})\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_2}} + P(\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_3}})\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v_3}} + \ ...$$

This is all the details we need to begin our talk about **tensors**!

Letâ€™s describe a hypothetical particle that has both <em>spin</em> and <em>color</em>. The possible configurations for the <em>spin</em> state is â†‘ or â†“ and ğŸ”´ or ğŸ”µ for <em>color</em>. 
And we know the probabilities for the particles <em>spin</em> and <em>color</em> as

$$P(â†‘) = 0.5 \quad  P(â†“) = 0.5 \quad P(ğŸ”´) = 0.7 \quad P(ğŸ”µ) = 0.3 $$

We now have two different states vectors to describe this particle

$$ \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} = P(â†‘)\ *â†‘ + \ P(â†“)\ *â†“ = 0.5\ *â†‘ + \ 0.5\ *â†“ $$

$$ \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}} = P(ğŸ”´)\ *ğŸ”´ + \ P(ğŸ”µ)\ *ğŸ”µ =0.7\ *ğŸ”´ + \ 0.3\ *ğŸ”µ $$

Instead of dealing with the two vectors $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ our goal is to package these vectors into a new vector that can fully represent our particle.

Let $T$ be our <em>packaging function</em> that takes our two different state vectors $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ into a new single state vector $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{z}} = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$

$$T(\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}}, \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}) = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$$

Where $âŠ—$ is just a symbol for the combination of $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$.

There is already some basic things we know about this new vector $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{z}} = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$

1. All possible configurations of $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ is a combination of configurations of $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$.
This is a complicated way of saying our particle can only end up as one of these four configurations

$$â†‘, \ ğŸ”´ \quad  â†“, \ ğŸ”´  \quad â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ \quad â†“, \ ğŸ”µ $$

2. Probabilities of the new configurations is a multiplication of the configurations involved.
For example the probability that the particle has <em>spin</em> â†‘ and <em>color</em> ğŸ”´ is

$$P(â†‘, ğŸ”´) = P(â†‘) * P(ğŸ”´) = 0.5 * 0.7 = 0.35 $$

By using the same formula we get the other three probabilities

$$P(â†“, ğŸ”´) = 0.35 \quad P(â†‘, ğŸ”µ) = 0.15 \quad P(â†“, ğŸ”µ) = 0.15 $$

We are now ready to write the new state vector $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{z}} = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ as a linear combination of its possible configurations and corresponding probabilities

$$\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{z}} = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}} = P(â†‘,ğŸ”´)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†“,ğŸ”´)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†‘,ğŸ”µ)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ) + P(â†“,ğŸ”µ)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”µ) = \\ P(â†‘)*P(ğŸ”´)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†“)*P(ğŸ”´)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†‘)*P(ğŸ”µ)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ) + P(â†“)*P(ğŸ”µ)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”µ) = \\ 0.35*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”´) + 0.35*(â†“, \ ğŸ”´) + 0.15*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ) + 0.15*(â†“, \ ğŸ”µ)$$

Now we turn back to our packaging function $T$. If we expand $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}},\ \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ into their linear combination we get the following

$$ T(P(â†‘)\ *â†‘ + \ P(â†“)\ *â†“,\ P(ğŸ”´)\ *ğŸ”´ + \ P(ğŸ”µ)\ *ğŸ”µ) = \\ P(â†‘)*P(ğŸ”´)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†“)*P(ğŸ”´)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”´) + P(â†‘)*P(ğŸ”µ)*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ) + P(â†“)*P(ğŸ”µ)*(â†“, \ ğŸ”µ) = \\ 0.35*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”´) + 0.35*(â†“, \ ğŸ”´) + 0.15*(â†‘, \ ğŸ”µ) + 0.15*(â†“, \ ğŸ”µ) $$

We recognize that this is equal to moving sums and probabilities outside the function for both arguments.

This <em>packaging function T</em> where the sums and probabilities behave this way is called <em>bilinear</em>. 

We can now turn to the definition of a **tensor**. A **tensor** is an element of the product of two vector spaces with an associated <em>bilinear</em> function. It should now be clear that this new state vector $\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{z}} = \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{v}} âŠ— \overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{w}}$ is a **tensor**. Since it is a product of vectors with an associated <em>bilinear</em> function.

Just by combining two independent states, <em>spin</em> and <em>color</em> of a particle, in a way that probabilities are calculated properly, we arrive that the new state must be a **tensor** product of the other two states. 

How exciting!
